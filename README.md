# Adversarial Training of Neural Networks

In this repository, you can find two jupyter notebooks where the adverserial samples are generated step by step using FGSM attack and training two different neural network architectures(LeNet-5 and VGG-Net) with them. In the presentation the results are compared and analyzed.
