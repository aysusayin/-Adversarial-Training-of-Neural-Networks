# Adversarial Training of Neural Networks

In this repository, you can find two jupyter notebooks where the adverserial samples are generated step by step using FGSM attack and training two different neural network architectures(LeNet-5 and VGG-Net) with them. They are explained in detail in the notebooks:
1. [Generating Adversarial Samples Using FGSM Attack](Generate_Adversarial_Samples.ipynb)
2. [Training of the models using German Sign Classification dataset](German_Sign_Classification.ipynb)


In the [presentation](Adversarial%20Training%20of%20Neural%20Networks.pdf) the results are compared and analyzed.
